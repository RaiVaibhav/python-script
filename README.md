# Travel time calculator

Hello! Command-line lover, who wants to use the web browser to know how long it will take between two locations when you have this great command-line script to do that? Nobody, right?
Congratulations, you will no longer need to leave your beloved terminal for this.

## What does the script do?
The script calculates the time it will take you to go from location A to location B. You can choose between bicycling, driving or walking.

## Installing the dependencies
### `googlemaps` package
This script require the `googlemaps` package. To install this package, do:
```zsh
$> pip3 install googlemaps
```
If you have any issues with permission, consider using `sudo`.
### Getting your GoogleMaps API key
#### From your browser
Visit the [google maps direction API website](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/) and click on **get a key** on the top right corner. Then follow the instructions and copy your key into the script here:
```python
# (API key) : Google maps API key
GOOGLE_MAP_API_KEY = 'myawsomeapikey'
```
#### From your console
* Go to the Google API Console.

* Create or select a project.

* Click Continue to enable the API and any related services.

* On the Credentials page, get an API key.
Note: If you have an existing unrestricted API key, or a key with browser restrictions, you may use that key.

* From the dialog displaying the API key, select Restrict key to set a browser restriction on the API key.

* In the Key restriction section, select HTTP referrers (web sites), then follow the on-screen instructions to set referrers.
